Create message templates:

```
cp data/templates/example.message.html data/templates/message.html
cp data/templates/example.message.txt data/templates/message.txt
```

Change the template names of each new file respectively:

```diff
data/templates/message.html

-{{define "example_message_html"}}
+{{define "message_html"}}
```

```diff
data/templates/message.txt

-{{define "example_message_txt"}}
+{{define "message_txt"}}
```

Amend new recipients file, ensuring that contents are valid YAML and retain the same `.name` and `.email` format per recipient.
